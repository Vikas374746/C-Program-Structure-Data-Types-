Expt 2 â€“ C++ Program Structure (Data Types)
Title of the Experiment
Program to input and display values of various C++ data types and print their memory size using sizeof().

Tools Used
Programming Language: C++

Compiler: g++ or any standard C++ compiler

IDE: Code::Blocks / VS Code / OnlineGDB

Theory
C++ supports various built-in data types such as:

int: Integer numbers

float: Decimal numbers

double: High-precision decimal numbers

char: Single characters

bool: True or False values

string: Sequence of characters (from C++ STL)

sizeof() Operator
Used to determine the memory size of a variable or data type in bytes.

Storage Classes
auto: Default for local variables

register: Suggests storing in CPU register

static: Retains value between function calls

extern: Refers to a global variable declared elsewhere

Algorithm (Summarized):

1. Start
2. Declare variables: int, float, double, char, string, and bool
3. Input values for all variables from the user
4. Display each value along with its size using sizeof()
5. Use cin.ignore() and getline() for string input
6. Use boolalpha to display true/false instead of 1/0
7. End

Conclusion
This experiment helps understand basic C++ data types, how memory is allocated to them, and how to use the sizeof() operator. It also introduces storage classes which control variable scope and lifetime.
